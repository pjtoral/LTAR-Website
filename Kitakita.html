                    <div class="intro">
                        <p style="text-indent: 40px;"> Kita Kita; I see you~  Have you ever been blinded by love? 
                            Kita Kita is a movie about a woman named Lea who was literally 
                            blinded because of love, or rather a broken heart.. Sometime later, a stranger with a kind heart and pure intentions introduces himself. His name was Tonyo, he was a Filipino just like Lea and he was there, he was present, he saw Lea. Tonyo eventually gets Lea’s acquaintance and gets her to tour with him around the city. 
                            Tonyo became Lea’s eyes when Lea’s world was pitch black. 
                            As they continually spend time with each other they eventually fall in love. <br><br>They make a promise to revisit every 
                            single place they went to when Lea regains her sight. But the very moment she
                            regains her sight, the first thing she sees is the death of the very person she 
                            loved. After the tragedy of death, Lea discovers a letter he left for her. It was
                            revealed that Tonyo, having suffered a broken heart became a person regularly drunk.  <br><br>
                            It was Lea who saw him and showed him genuine kindness. The letter reveals that he has
                            had heart problems since he was a young child, he was told that it would burst at any moment,
                            which is why he wanted to do everything for Lea. But how do you tell someone you love them, 
                            when no words can escape you tight lips?  Communicating is broad and hard especially when the 
                            people you are communicating with have lost a part of their sense, just like Lea. However,
                            relating to the first axiom, which is "one cannot not communicate", even though Lea has lost 
                            her sight, it didn't hinder Tonyo to convey and show his feelings and intentions to her in any 
                            way possible.  <br><br> Agreeing to Koike et al. in their study within the year 1988, they found that 
                            regardless of the subject, individuals are able to communicate emphatically regardless of disabilities;
                            in this manner, though Tonyo has not directly communicated with Lea of what he felt during the time he
                            was alive, Lea was able to receive the message. Oftentimes people communicate despite being silent. Just 
                            like the scene where Tonyo disguises himself in a banana, completely being mute. He was there and he chose
                            to be with Lea. Even though he did not say anything, because he was perceived by Lea communication was already
                            happening.  <br><br>The mere fact that Tonyo was there was enough for Lea to know that she had someone she could 
                            talk to, despite the silence. Paul Watzlawick once said that the very process of communication starts 
                            the moment two people perceive each other, and indeed it is true that our actions speak louder than our words.
                             Even when Tonyo did not have words to speak, he was speaking louder than most. His presence communicated care, 
                             his gestures showed genuinity, his aura radiated love, and Lea saw this in a such way that didn’t need sight.
                              You can never not communicate, because with every word, sentence, or action we let out,commit, or keep we are making a 
                              statement. And we communicate our way through every single second in this life the very moment we are perceived; 
                            The very moment we are seen; The very moment people say “Kita Kita”. </p>
