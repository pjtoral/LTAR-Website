                    <h2>STARTING OVER AGAIN</h2>
                    <p> Pumar, Zhy Toni Ann  &  Rivera, Ricardo Rodrigo</p>
                    <div class="intro">
                        <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Starting Over Again is a Filipino romantic-drama film depicting the frustration
                            of two ex lovers, Genina (played by Toni Gonzaga) & Marco (Piolo Pascual), who meet again
                            when tasked with an architectural project. Our group chose the scene in which Piolo Pascual
                            uttered his famous line, "Anong karapatan mong hingin ang isang bagay na pinagdamot
                            mong ibigay? I deserved an explanation. I deserve an acceptable reason.” Set in Marco's
                            ancestral house to be designed and renovated by Genina, both were arguing about why
                            Marco always disapproved of Genina's design for the project. During their argument,
                            Genina brought up their heartbreaking past, saying "O baka naman kaya ayaw mong aminin
                            dahil hanggang ngayon ako pa rin ang gusto mo," which triggered Marco. In the next
                            moments, Marco was able to express his emotions, which he had been holding in for so
                            long, which caused Genina to go silent. Then, after Marco vented his emotions, Genina
                            realized her mistake and apologized to Marco. They then talked about their breakup years
                            ago, why Genina left, and how they were both feeling as their emotions poured out. At the
                            end of the scene, Marco told Genina that he couldn't trust her because she had broken his
                            trust.
                            <br><br>The axiom of communication our group has chosen to highlight is the first
                            one, which posits that “one cannot not communicate”. This axiom postulates the idea that
                            when an individual encounters another individual, the communication process begins. Albeit
                            through a verbal or nonverbal exchange, language isn't limited to the words we use. The
                            scene we have chosen for this paper is riddled with this axiom as there are many
                            observations that can be made and discussed about the aforementioned principle. Firstly,
                            the scene opens with Piolo actively walking away from Toni in a pace that hurries himself
                            out of the situation. Although it is not outwardly uttered, the body language depicts his
                            annoyance to the situation or perhaps his internal frustration. This is then followed by Toni's
                            tone of voice which is mixed with frustration and anger. Putting aside the use of words, the
                            pitch she uses communicates her deep feelings towards the situation. As a rebuttal, Piolos
                            voice also exerts effort and frustration, alluding to the underlying human condition that is
                            anger towards the situation. Sarcasm is also mixed in when he replies to Toni's character.
                            The tone of voice expressed by both parties portrays the hurt from their past that was left
                            unresolved. Towards the end of the scene, Toni's self concept crumbles as she realizes that
                            she is wrong and feels remorse, this is manifested outwardly by hugging him and the tears
                            that run down her face as she's crippled in silence. The facial expressions used in the
                            discourse between the two parties displays hurt, anger and frustration towards a failed
                            relationship.<br><br> Paul Watzlawick's Axioms of Communication can be seen in all forms of
                            communication between individuals. Whether or not the mode of communication is verbal or
                            nonverbal, language transcends beyond the words we use. Language can be depicted
                            throughout many facets of conveying a message.</p>
