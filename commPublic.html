                  <h3>Can teachers and students be friends?</h3>  
                  <p>I believe that it is very possible for teachers and students to be friends, similar to how the boss of the company can be friends with an employee. Although the relational status is complementary, meaning there might is unequal power in communication (boss-employee, parent-child, teacher-student), the possibility of friendship is still present which in turn results into a symmetrical form of communication. The question really lies within what boundaries they set in their friendship. For example, the teacher-student tandem could prefer to keep things professional in a classroom setting but be very good friends outside the premises of their school.</p>

                      <h3>Can teachers and students be friends?</h3>  
                      <p>Yes, it is possible for students and teachers to be friends, however, both parties should keep in mind to always maintain a positive student-teacher relationship wherein they do not cross each other's boundaries because having an adult-type of friendship can affect both parties since in an adult-type friendship a teacher and student would be considered equal. Teachers are considered as mentors to their students where they help you with your future endeavors that's why a student cannot treat their teachers how they treat their friends or peers.  </p>

                          <p>Yes, teachers and students can be friends as long as the boundaries of friendship remain. Personally, my teachers become my friends but I respect them as a friend and as a teacher, and they respect me as a student and as a friend as well. Friendship can be complex, however, teachers and students can still be friends as long as they both know their limitations and boundaries. </p>

                              <h3>Can teachers and students be friends?</h3>  
                              <p>Yes, teachers and students can be friends, but there are boundaries. They should not be all over each other. They should remain teachers/students, not true friends. Outside of the school, teachers and students can be friends so that the teacher can also show professionalism. Also, they won't make other students feel like they are biased or they have their favorite.
                                For me, being friends with teachers is a privilege and opportunity. No matter how close our relationship as teacher-student, I still have to respect them and know where to draw the line. That's why most teachers would say, "I can be close with my students outside, I can be your friend, but here inside the classroom, I am strict”. I can still remember our 9th-grade advisory teacher also told us that. He was friends with many students (including us) outside the classroom and even made fun with each other. But, once we were inside the classroom, we would lessen our closeness. We had our limits. </p>

                                  <h3>Can teachers and students be friends?</h3>  
                                  <p>This question may be conventional for some because when asked, one would assume that the student is a minor and the teacher is an adult. In that context, it might be strange if viewed from a perspective outside the periphery of said friendship. When I lived in Australia, it was strictly not allowed. Students and teachers couldn't be friends and no physical contact was even allowed. Here in the Philippines its quite different. During my late high school years, we were friends with the teachers. However that's because of the nature of our school and the small age gap between the students and the teachers. This leads to another case wherein the student and teacher are both adults who both have consent in the friendship. So to ask the question if teachers and students being friends, I would say that it is highly situational and requires speculation on the factors before we can make any judgments.</p>
