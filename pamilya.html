                    <div class="intro">
                        <p style="text-indent: 40px;"> Pamilya Ordinaryo also known as Ordinary People, is an independent film that
                            portrays a teenage couple who lives in the streets of Manila and barely makes a living as
                            pickpockets. Their lives completely changed when they had to endure the chaotic streets of
                            Manila as they had to take desperate measures to find their newly-born child that had been
                            kidnapped. This movie portrays the grim real-life experiences and reality of Filipino street
                            children and how they are treated by society.
                             <br><br>In the scene where Aries and Jane (the teenage couple in the movie) played with
                             their newly stolen phone, their conversation is full of banter and would casually throw
                             profanities at each other which can be explained by Axiom 2 which implies that there are
                             both content and relationship levels of communication. The content aspect of this axiom
                             pertains to the mere context and what a person communicates verbally. The relationship
                             aspect, however, pertains to how the content is conveyed based on the drawn relationship
                             between the sender and receiver<br><br>
                             In the movie, the way Aries and Jane communicate implies that the teenage couple
                             is aware that their words are proper for the context and people present and their relational
                             aspect enables them to communicate freely. It was also present in the scene how they use
                             the tone in their voices as well as their facial expressions. They may casually throw
                             profanities at each other but their love and care for each other are also present. These types
                             of banter and interaction are really common not just for couples, but also among good
                             friends and casual acquaintances. It is also evident in other scenes that Aries and Jane do
                             not use profanities when talking to other people that they do not know because the couple
                             understands the use of context and relationship levels in communicating and how they
                             communicate with each other may be inappropriate for others.  <br><br> Overall, the particular scene in the movie is a great example of showing how the
                             Axiom (“Every communication has a content and relationship aspect”) is present in our
                             day-to-day lives. Similar to how some of us would communicate with our friends, we could
                             use offensive words when giving feedback but doing that towards an out-of-work colleague
                             would leave a bad impression. Hence, in communication, one should always think about the
                             context of their messages before speaking for the people present in the conversation. We
                             should always be aware of the relationship aspect within the communication and make sure
                             that our words don’t fall outside the level of communication with our listeners.</p>
