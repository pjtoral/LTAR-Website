                        <p >Marriage is a lifelong journey that takes a lot of commitment
                            and compromise. According to studies on marital satisfaction,
                            there are factors that contribute to a satisfactory marital
                            union, namely these factors are: love, trust, respect, and
                            fidelity (Kaslow & Robinson, 1996). Indeed a relationship is
                            nothing without these factors. In this analytic essay we look
                            into how these factors play a role in a newly married couple.
                            We look into interviewing Rosario Elena Toral-Soledad on her
                            relationship with her husband Carlo Soledad.<br>

                            I have chosen to interview my best friend for almost 8 years, John
                            Jeremiah Silva “JJ”. He and I met when we were both 13 years old, but we didn’t
                            get close until we were around 15. Our friendship has lasted almost a decade and
                            our relationship is something we both hold dear to our hearts. In high school, we
                            were like coffee and cream. We always went hand in hand together, tackled many
                            challenges together and even traveled together. Despite our differences, we have
                            always found a common ground that kept us close.

                            There’s an old common phrase that goes “Dogs are a man’s best friend.” In
                            fact, dogs are the oldest domestic animal and have been living with humans for
                            approximately 10,000 years (Messent and Serpel, 1981). Most pet owners know
                            that these animals are not just mere pets but they consider them as part of their
                            families as well. Pet relationships do not only go one way instead it is a two-way
                            relationship wherein pet owners are not the only one who gives love and care for
                            the animals but they also receive the same love and affection from their animals.
                            According to Cusack (1988), animals are a man’s confidant where there is no risk of
                            betrayal.

                        <p >Have you ever wondered how your parents managed to provide you with all of your
                            necessities? How your mother still struggles to raise a child even with the help of
                            your father? Now, imagine a single mother raising a child with having no one to rely
                            on, wherein she is required to be able to manage everything all by herself. Parents,
                            even single parents are indeed superheroes. Meet our real-life superhero-- Clair
                            Jane Tumulak, 21 years old, is a single mother with one child. She got pregnant
                            when she was eighteen years old. She is the strongest and bravest person that I
