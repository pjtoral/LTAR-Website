                            Kita Kita is a movie about a woman named Lea who was literally 
                            blinded because of love, or rather a broken heart.. Sometime later, a stranger with a kind heart and pure intentions introduces himself. His name was Tonyo, he was a Filipino just like Lea and he was there, he was present, he saw Lea. Tonyo eventually gets Lea’s acquaintance and gets her to tour with him around the city. 
                            Tonyo became Lea’s eyes when Lea’s world was pitch black.

                            when tasked with an architectural project. Our group chose the scene in which Piolo Pascual
                            uttered his famous line, "Anong karapatan mong hingin ang isang bagay na pinagdamot
                            mong ibigay? I deserved an explanation. I deserve an acceptable reason.” Set in Marco's
                            ancestral house to be designed and renovated by Genina, both were arguing about why
                            Marco always disapproved of Genina's design for the project........ </p>
