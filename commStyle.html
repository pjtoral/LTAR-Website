                    <h1>PAUL JOHN TORAL</h1>
                    <p>My predominant communication style is assertive style. I really relate to this communication style because I am always so open when communicating with other people and I love to have a good conversation. Not just merely talking or listening but really having in-depth communication where all parties are involved. The people with whom I most often use this style are my family and friends. I openly communicate anything I feel because I have learned the hard way that bottling up your thoughts and emotions will not do you any good. I believe that this communication style is very effective because it allows me to make sure that my emotions and thoughts are heard. This really helps me become a more effective communicator, making sure that everyone I talk to hears and understands me while I try to hear them out and understand them as well. </p>

                    <h1>KHENNEN LI DAYANAN</h1>
                    <p>My predominant communication style is passive-aggresive. I am usually passive-aggresive
                        towards my family and people that I do not get along that much. This is evident when I 
                        am angry, hurt, and disappointed when something does not go to plan. My family 
                        and friends now when I'm angry because I get silent and do not want to tell them how I feel.
                        I feel like I do not know how to express my emotions well enough which leads to me indirectly expressing my emotions
                        , thoughts, and needs. This makes me geel bad for the people around me because they might get hurt by how
                        I process my emotions and needs. I would like to improve my communication style because I don't think
                        this style of communication will benefit me and the people around me in the future.

                    <p>
                        My predominant communication style is a mix between assertive & passive-aggressive. 
                        I freely express my thoughts and ideals to those who I am comfortable with. I respect when 
                        people talk and I try to listen. However whenever I get moody or have issues, something stops
                        me from talking about it and I just shut my mouth. But people have often remakred that they can tell when I 
                        am upset or moody. I am a very open person and I can make friends with anyone. So maybe to
                        some degree those whom I have a shallow relationship won't be able to see all of me. However, those who know me well
                        or those whom I have had relations with for a long time would probably witness my communication style.
                        Since there are two communication styles I see, I would say that the two are at equal parts. So the 
                        juxtaposition between the two is evident, which leads me to say that they may be state dependent and situational.

                    <p>My predominant communication style is a mix of assertive and passve styles. I can say this because
                        at soem point I chose to express my thoughts clearly and sometimes, I avoud expressing my thoughts
                        and emotions. The people with whom I most often use this style are literally everyone. I am not 
                        pretentious about how I feel and I am always the same person to everyone. I can assert that who I am today,
                         will be who I am tomorrow. I can say that my communication style is very effective as it explains 
                         and elaborates who I am inside and out. I do not need to pretend
                         to have validations on how I express myself, but rather, I tend to go with the flow and adjust 
                         to people around me as they also adjust for me.

                    <h1>ERIKA ANNE TUMULAK</h1>
                    <p>The people with whom I most often use this style are:
                        I am usually passive-aggressive to my family and my significant other. I can't express my feelings well. That is why I tend to isolate myself to avoid everyone and everything, including expressing my feelings and emotions. The reason is that I am afraid they might think I am complaining, and I do not know how to express my thoughts. Even if I will, I don't think they understand me. That's why I avoid everything.
                        
                        I used silent treatment as my coping mechanism, especially to my significant other, even if it was eating me up. For me, it is way better to avoid explaining what's bothering me than opening up. Every time I open up, they will use it next time to trigger me instead of understanding what I have expressed. They misunderstand everything that I will say, which will lead to a fight. This is also the reason why I have anger issues. That is why avoiding is much easier than arguing.
                        
                        This is my way of communicating because I always get neglected every time I express my feelings. I just disappointed myself for expecting that they would fully understand me instead of defending themselves and telling me to stop complaining.
                        
                        Level of effectiveness and how it affects me
                        It is effective. It is like reverse psychology, but it is a very toxic way of communicating which also affects me the most. I can't sleep thinking that I should have told my feelings, I could have done better, and that it is way easier if we've talked everything out. I tend to overthinking everything which is keeping me up every night. However, I am learning to change this toxic trait of mine and I am willing to outgrow this way of communicating. It is a bad habit. It is unhealthy not only for me but also for the people around me. I am losing everyone and feel distant because of this bad habit.</p>
