                        <p style="text-indent: 40px;"> The movie Four Sisters and A Wedding is a drama-comedy about family relationships.
                             The four sisters, hearing about the wedding of their younger brother, reunite to dissuade their younger 
                             brother from marrying his fiancé (whom they don’t approve of). In the midst of their plans to sabotage the
                              wedding, the family, instead are forced by circumstances to face their own shortcomings and misunderstandings.
                             <br><br>Axiom 3: The Nature of a Relationship Depends on How Both Parties Punctuate the Communication Sequence is displayed.
                              Over the course of the movie it is shown that they have numerous (not so) hidden complaints about each other and in this scene 
                              it’s all splayed out. Their relationship amongst each other (particularly amongst the sisters) is full of complications because 
                              of all the times a family member has done something or said something, the others would internally interpret it in a way that causes
                               them to react negatively, or putting labels and having assumptions on certain behaviors caused by the siblings as well as their mother.
                              This doesn’t only apply to them as a family, but even the way they react to the fiancé of their brother (as well as the fiancé’s family). <br><br>
                              This is all explicitly shown in the scene at the peak climax of the movie where they finally shed all pretense and have a heart-to-heart
                               talk about all their hurt and misunderstandings over the years amongst themselves. Bea, one of the four sisters, had been hurt all
                                these years, feeling somewhat neglected and loved less (stating that her mother has favorites) due to the numerous instances where 
                                her mother seemingly prioritizes her sibling, Teddie, over her, no matter the achievements she seemed to showcase and all the sacrifices
                                 she had to make for the betterment of her siblings. <br><br> This is all explicitly shown in the scene at the peak climax of the movie
